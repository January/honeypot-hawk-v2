Simple Telnet & SSH Honeypots
==============================
This is a small Python project that aims to produce simple, easy to understand and use honeypots that impersonate Telnet and SSH servers, and log details about users who attempted to log in. Next up is a version that also requests a password before ejecting the user. SSH is currently not finished, but that too is coming soon.
